		<h2>Buckle up, bitch. This is gonna be long.</h2>
		<h3>(I love you!!)</h3>
		<p>I wish I could get across to you how much I lvoe and care about you Kira. I try my best to do just that, but I know I'm fucking retarded and most of the time I can't truly express how I feel about you, or emotions in general. Partly because I don't like to come across as a little bitch, partly because it doesn't come naturally to me to pour out my emotions (especially in a way that people can receive them the way I want them to). Writing is one of the only ways I know how to get everything <span>inside</span> of me <span>outside</span> of me. (That's what she said, I know Kira. *eyeroll*)</p>
		<p>For a long time in my life I felt unloveable. If not feeling unloveable at the time, I felt like I was incapable of truly loving anyone or anything. But Kira, you have changed that. You have helped me feel genuine emotion and understand how it is to actually be loved and cared about on a deep level! I know I actually and truly love you because even though we get into some god awful viscious fights and arguments where I get pissed off to the extreme, I haven't packed my shit and GTFO'd. Normally when something (people or anything really) frustrates me like that, I will just drop the thing or person and sever ties with them completely. I know that's shitty of me, but I don't do it intentionally. It's just something my dipshit brain does.</p>
		<p>The thing with you that is so fundamentally different and confusing to me is that I literally CANNOT distance myself from you or close up. And to be honest, that actually scares the living shit out of me! I'm glad that's the case though, damn. You are the only person I will ever truly be able to love. I'm confident of that. And I know that I could get through life on my own and be functional/survive, but I'd so much rather experience life with you! I'd so much rather journey through the shitstorm of life with you rather than without you. You make such a monumental difference Kira :)</p>
		<p>I know I'm far from perfect, but I am trying harder than I ever have tried to get my shit in order so that we can have a bright future together! I know I fuck up a lot, especially in the worst of times. But I learn from it everytime, even if it is just a small bit of knowledge/experience I gain. And then after I am done being a pussy, I pull myself up by my bootstraps and make calculated necessary changes to my behavior/life.</p>
		<p>I've messed up with finances, with work, with my meds, etc. The list goes on. But more than ever I am so determined to clean my self up. I like to push things out of my head and procrastinante, but I can't do that anymore.</p>
		<p>A life (and eventually a family) with you is what I want more than anything in this world. And it's time for me to prove that I'm not fucking around when I say that and that it's more than just meaningless words that escape from my mouth!.<p>
		<p>I'm starting a spreadsheet to keep track of finances. No more of me taking shortcuts with financial institutions to make a quick buck.</p>
		<p>I'm continuously working on a balanced way to manage my medication so I don't fly off the handle and fuck everything up.</p>
		<p>I'm going to start a running list of goals for me (and you if you want) and goals for us as a team. The individual goals will help feed into the success of our goals as a couple I think.</p>
		<p>I'm busing my ass off with work and am about to reach out to another client that I believe will allow me to do a good deal of work for them. It pains me to take time to work when I constantly want to hang out with you. Literally, I can't get enough of you Kira. Pretty gay, I know. But It's the truth and reality of the situation.</p>
		<p>Though it's hard for me to work, I know it's critical to us having a good future together. Not to be cocky, but I am DAMN good at what I do. And I can generate enough income for us to live comfortably as long as I find a balance with working and hanging out. And right now I'm having to work harder than ever and put in more time than usual. That's the only way I will be able to have a comfortable balance with this stuff down the road. A lot of work now for a comfortable amount of work later</p>
		<p>You always tell me that song "Hard to Love" is about you, but I know damn well it applies to me as well. I am a fucking pain in the ass. I know that. I don't mean to be, but I know I can get pretty unbearable. Thank you so much for putting up with my shit this far. And please, I'm begging you to put up with my shit a while longer. The past several weeks have been some of the hardest I've lived through. I've lost nearly everything I turn to for comfort. My car (ultimate symbol of freedom), my income, my relationship with my uncle, my reputation at work, and sometimes my sanity hahaha. But I've still got you and I'll be damned if I lose you too.</p>
		<p>So this is me Kira, promising like I've never promised before in my life, to get my shit together and be a stronger person. Both for me and for our future together. This is the most sincere way I know how to say I'm serious about building a life with you, and serious about you being the one person on this god awful planet that I have ever loved, DO love, and will helplessly continue to love. And I mean "Love" in every capacity of that complicated, loaded, and confusing word.</p>
		<p>Theres a lot more I wanted to write but I am out of time. I love you!</p>
		<h3>I MEAN it babe!!</h3>

		<h1>TL;DR: Please say "YES"!!</h1>
